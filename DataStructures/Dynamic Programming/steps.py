# Steps
# A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, 
# or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many 
# possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

# basic recursive method
def steps(n):
    pass

print(steps(4))


# Steps (Dynamic, Memoized)
def memoized_steps(n):
    pass


# helper function
def memoized_steps_helper(n, r):
    pass

print(memoized_steps(4))


# Steps (Dynamic, Bottom Up)
def bottom_up_steps(n):
    pass

print (bottom_up_steps(4))
