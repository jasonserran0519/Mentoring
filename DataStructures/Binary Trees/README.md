# Files

## pseudocode.md
Explains what to do.

## binary_search_tree.py
Provides beginner code and instructions.

## bst_guided.py
Use if struggling, looking for structure, and help on implementation of methods.

### ```display()```
bst_guided.py has a display helper function for printing the bst in python. Feel free to paste it in your ```TreeNode``` class.

### Remember
This is supposed to be challenging. I recommend you use the pseudocode.md and create everything yourself. Get used to creating your own ```objects``` and ```classes```. 

You will be expected to be comfortable in OOP, data structures, and the fundamental manipulation of data structures.
