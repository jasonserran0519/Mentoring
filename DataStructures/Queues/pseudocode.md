# Pseudocode
Encompasses two classes, ```Node()``` and ```Queue()```

## ```Node```
Each node has three attributes, ```data```, ```next```, ```prev```.

## ```Stack```
A Stack has two attributes, a ```head``` and a ```tail```.

## Tasks
Create the following methods:
1. ```enqueue``` - Add a node to the end of the queue.
2. ```dequeue``` - Remove a node from the front of the queue.
3. ```peek``` - View the front-most value of the queue.
4. ```isEmpty``` - Returns true if the queue is empty.
5. ```size``` - Returns the size of the queue.
6. ```printQueue``` - Print the elements in the stack.
7. ```cleqr()``` - Clears the queue.

Create a queue using your ```enqueue``` function, implement a way to _print_ it, and successfully call all methods properly, showing accurate usage of them with your printing function. 

### Clarifications
```pass``` is inputed to avoid errors. It is not appropriate code and should not remain in your working methods.
