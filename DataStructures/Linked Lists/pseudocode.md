# Pseudocode
A LinkedList consists of a list of connected Nodes.

## ```Node``` class
A node has two attributes, a ```val``` and a pointer to the ```next``` node.

## ```LinkedList``` class
A LinkedList has two attributes, a ```head``` and a ```count``` to keep track of its length.

## Tasks
Implement the following methods:
1. Override ```len()``` to return the LinkedList's length.
2. Print the LL.
3. Get value at a certain index.
4. Add in front of the head.
5. Basic insert.
6. Basic delete.
7. Add after the tail.
8. Add at a specific index.
9. Delete at a specific index.
10. Return the max value.
11. Return the min value.

Your code must create the LinkedList and manipulate it accordingly with the wanted methods.

### Clarifications
```pass``` is placeholder code to avoid errors. It should not remain in your finished methods.

## To Challenge Yourself
Use ```addAtHead()``` to create the list. 

Create a new method ```sort_linkedlist()``` which sorts the values in ascending order.

Optimize the method ```sort_linkedlist()``` with **merge sort**.
