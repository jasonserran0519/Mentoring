## pseudocode.md
Explains what to do.

## heap_guided.py
Use if struggling, looking for structure, and help on implementation of methods.

### ```hprint()```
heap_guided.py has a display helper function for printing the heap in python. Feel free to paste it outside of your ```Heap``` class.

### Remember
This is supposed to be challenging. I recommend you use the pseudocode.md and create everything yourself. Get used to creating your own ```objects``` and ```classes```. 

You will be expected to be comfortable in OOP, data structures, and the fundamental manipulation of them.
